# Artificial Neural Networks in Java

This repository contains a data structure for Artificial Neural Networks (feed-forward and acyclic).  
It also has a pure Backpropagation algorithm that can be applied.  
The ANN can be created using an array to describe the structure. For example, [2, 3, 4, 2] means:
  - 2 nodes in the input layer
  - 2 hidden layers having 3 and 4 nodes, respectively
  - 2 nodes in the output layer
  
For a quick run, modify the struture and training data in Test.java and run the file.
